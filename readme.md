### Application Summary
This webmap was created as part of a final project for GHY 5818 at Appalachian State University. Its objectives are as follows:
* to create a world map highlighting countries that have a refugee resettlement program through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
* to share information about these programs
* to encourage awareness of refugee resettlement, where such programs exist, and how many people they resettle

Refugee resettlement is a complex process where those granted "refugee" status by the United Nations, for whom it is not feasible to return to their country, may apply to permanently live in another country.Â This country is typically different from the country where they have sought asylum, and the resettlement process can take upwards of a decade depending on many factors such as the refugee's origin, how many people are in their family, and the nation where they are applying for resettlement. More information can be found at [this link](https://www.unhcr.org/us/what-we-do/build-better-futures/long-term-solutions/resettlement).

As part of my thesis for my Masters' in Geography at Appalachian State, I am looking into various refugee resettlement programs and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data to determine the similarities and differences between programs around the world. This project, alongside being my term project for GHY 5818, can also serve as a partial introduction to my thesis project.

### Article Inspiration
The article that served as inspiration for this project can be found [here](https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/press-releases/unhcr-global-refugee-resettlement-needs-grow-2024). It is a press release from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees from June of 2023.
